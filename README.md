## Discovering Opportunities for Optimizing OpenShift Energy Consumption

Containers have gained widespread usage in the cloud computing domain, supporting emerging applications like IoT, serverless computing, vehicular networks, and smart infrastructure projects.
Within this context, the scheduling of containers becomes a critical area to explore for efficient resource management. While numerous algorithms have been developed, spanning mathematical modeling to machine learning, 
these solutions often target a single objective, which may not align with real-world deployment scenarios. OpenShift, for instance, presents a challenge with multiple objectives, including energy consumption, cost, networking, 
memory, processor utilization, cooling, and storage, among others. As global data center energy consumption continues to rise, optimizing for sustainability becomes paramount.

The primary objective is to leverage machine learning techniques for identifying the optimal utilization point in a system, referred to as the "sweet spot." This sweet spot represents the ideal number of containers to schedule to a specific node that maximizes its energy efficiency. With this utilization-to-sweet spot function, the scheduler can now consider sweet spot utilizations when making decisions about node allocation and container placement.
